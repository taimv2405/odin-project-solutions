## Skills Demonstrated

- **HTML Structure:** Using semantic tags like `<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<p>`.
- **Links:** Working with absolute and relative paths to link pages together.
- **Images:** Embedding images correctly and organizing them in directories.
- **Lists:** Using ordered lists for steps and unordered lists for ingredients.
- **File Management:** Maintaining a clean project structure with separate folders for images and pages.

## Recipes

This website currently features the following recipes:
1. **Lasagna:** A classic meat and cheese lasagna.
2. **Spaghetti Carbonara:** A creamy, authentic Roman pasta dish.
3. **Chicken Curry:** A simple and flavorful curry with coconut milk.
