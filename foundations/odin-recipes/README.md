**Live Demo:** [View Project Live](https://taimv2405.github.io/odin-project-solutions/foundations/odin-recipes/)

This is the [Odin Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) project built as part of the Foundations course in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in basic HTML and CSS styling.

## Skills Demonstrated

### HTML
- **HTML Structure:** Using semantic tags like `<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<p>`.
- **Links:** Working with absolute and relative paths to link pages together.
- **Images:** Embedding images correctly and organizing them in directories.
- **Lists:** Using ordered lists for steps and unordered lists for ingredients.
- **File Management:** Maintaining a clean project structure with separate folders for images and pages.

### CSS
- **Selectors:** Using global (`*`), element (`a`), and class (`.container`, `.title`) selectors effectively.
- **Box Model:** Controlling layout with `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.
- **Layout Techniques:**
  - Using `box-sizing: border-box` for better size calculations.
  - Centering content blocks using `margin: 0 auto`.
  - Creating "bleed" effects with negative margins (`margin: -1rem`).
- **Typography & Visuals:**
  - Custom fonts (`font-family`) and text alignment.
  - Styling links to look like buttons.
  - Working with colors (`hex`, `hsl`, `rgba`, named colors).
