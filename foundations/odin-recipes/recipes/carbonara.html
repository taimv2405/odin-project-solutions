    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. It's creamy, rich, and incredibly satisfying without needing any heavy cream.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta: Spaghetti is the traditional choice, but rigatoni or fettuccine work well too.</li>
        <li>Meat: Guanciale (cured pork jowl) or pancetta are authentic, but bacon is a common substitute.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Fresh eggs create the creamy sauce. You'll need whole eggs and sometimes extra yolks.</li>
        <li>Cheese: Pecorino Romano is traditional, but Parmesan (Parmigiano-Reggiano) is also delicious.</li>
        <li>Black Pepper: Freshly cracked black pepper is essential for cutting through the richness.</li>
        <li>Garlic (Optional): While not traditional, a clove of garlic adds a nice aroma.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the pasta until al dente.</li>
        <li>Fry the pancetta or bacon in a pan until crisp, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, cheese, and pepper in a bowl to create the sauce base.</li>
        <li>Toss the hot pasta with the bacon fat, then remove from direct heat.</li>
        <li>Quickly mix in the egg mixture (the residual heat cooks the eggs without scrambling them).</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with extra cheese and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
