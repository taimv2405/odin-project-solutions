    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple chicken curry is full of flavor and comes together quickly. Tender chicken pieces are simmered in a spiced coconut milk sauce for a warming and hearty meal.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: Boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Onion and Ginger: Essential aromatics that form the base of the curry flavor.</li>
        <li>Spices: Curry powder, turmeric, cumin, and coriander bring the heat and earthiness.</li>
        <li>Coconut Milk: Full-fat coconut milk gives the sauce a rich and creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Tomato: A little tomato paste or chopped tomatoes adds acidity and color.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: You can add bell peppers, peas, or potatoes for extra nutrition.</li>
        <li>Cilantro: Fresh cilantro for garnish adds a burst of freshness.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté onions, ginger, and garlic in a pan until soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the spices and cook for a minute to release their oils.</li>

        <li>Pour in the coconut milk and tomatoes, then bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cook gently until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce thickens.</li>
